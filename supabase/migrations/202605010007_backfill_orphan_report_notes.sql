-- Backfill: create `report_notes` rows for orphan `file_metadata`
-- rows that belong to a report but were never linked.
--
-- Bug context
-- -----------
-- The mobile client used to insert `file_metadata` rows for image,
-- document, and voice-note uploads, but only the voice path created
-- a matching `report_notes` row — and even that path skipped rows
-- with empty transcriptions. Result: `file_metadata` could contain
-- rows that participated in a draft yet had no `report_notes` row
-- pointing at them. Reports rendered the orphan files anyway because
-- the UI listed all project files, not just files linked through
-- `report_notes`. The fix forbids that path going forward; this
-- migration repairs existing data.
--
-- Scope
-- -----
-- Only file_metadata rows that:
--   • are not soft-deleted
--   • carry a non-null `report_id` (the report they were captured for)
--   • have category in (voice-note, image, document, attachment)
--   • have NO existing report_notes row referencing them via file_id
--
-- A `report_notes` row is inserted with:
--   kind     = derived from category
--   body     = file_metadata.transcription for voice notes, otherwise NULL
--   author_id = file_metadata.uploaded_by
--   position = MAX(position) + 1 for the report
--   file_id  = file_metadata.id
--
-- Files with report_id IS NULL are left untouched — they are project
-- assets, not part of any specific report.
