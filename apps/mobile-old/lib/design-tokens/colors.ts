/**
 * Single source of truth for color tokens.
 *
 * Consumed by:
 *   - tailwind.config.js (NativeWind utility classes)
 *   - any .tsx file that needs a literal hex (Lucide icons,
 *     ActivityIndicator, Stack contentStyle, placeholderTextColor,
 *     react-native-svg fills, surface shadows, etc.)
 *
 * Do NOT inline hex strings anywhere else in `app/` or `components/`.
 *
 * Direction: warm-paper background with a softened navy chrome and a
 * single saturated orange accent reserved for the AI/hero action only.
 *
 *   - `foreground` / `primary` is softened from near-black `#1a1a2e` to
 *     `#2d3a5a`. The previous near-black contrast on warm paper (~16:1)
 *     was eye-fatiguing; the softer navy keeps the boxed-report identity
 *     established in commit b649f60 without the harsh ink-on-cream feel.
 *   - `accent` is now a bright, saturated orange (`#ea580c`). It is the
 *     ONE pop colour in the system — used exclusively by the AI hero
 *     CTA ("Update report"), the active tab underline, and equivalent
 *     "act here" affordances. It must NOT replace `primary` on routine
 *     chrome (Photo/Voice idle, audio play circle, tab background, etc.).
 *   - `warning` amber retains its semantic role ("Still missing", attn).
 *     `accent` orange is meaningfully more saturated so the two read as
 *     distinct roles (incomplete vs. act-here).
 *
 * Prior pivots reverted (do not silently re-attempt without surfacing):
 *   - earlier orange-accent direction — commit 46d504e — was muted amber
 *     applied broadly; this direction uses bright `#ea580c` reserved to
 *     a single element per viewport.
 *   - cool-slate redesign — PR #5.
